#################### Population-level RSF #########################
# We want to determine use within the NCA assuming 10 individuals #
# is a representative sample. When would this be the case? #

# When would it not be the case? #
# Answer: A sample of 10 individuals may be representative if the population using the NCA is small and homogenous or if the sample is randomly or stratified-selected. However, if the population is large and diverse, or if precise estimates are needed, a larger sample may be required to ensure reliability.

#view results
summary( msa_30m )

#as is best practice we add weights. Note that the weights cannot be 
# added to fit_rsf() function so we shift to the more flexible
# glmmTMB which allows weights, random effects and different distributions
msa_30m <- glmmTMB( case_ ~  1 + annual_30m + perennial_30m +

            family = binomial(), weights = weight ) 

#view results

#

#What about at our biggest scale?
# Answer: Not really
#

#which scale has the most support? We compare model fit using AIC
anova( msa_100m, msa_30m, msa_500m)

# Which scale is most supported by model selection?
# Answer: 100 meter scale was most supported 
#

# Interpreting results of the top model ###
# we start by exponentiating the coefficients:
exp( glmmTMB::fixef( msa_100m )$cond )
# this reflects the relative selection strength for choosing each
# vegetation cover when the remaining vegetation covers are kept 
# at their mean values
# Thus prairie falcons are 1.45 times more likely to choose
# shrub with cover that is 1 SD higher when annual and perennial are 
# kept at their mean

# To remind ourselves what the SD for our predictor is
apply( df_sa[,prednames], 2, sd )
# And now the mean values for each habitat:
apply( df_sa[,prednames], 2, mean )

# So a Prarie will be 1.45 times more likely to use an area with 10 %
# shrub than 2.5 % shrub when annual is 13. 6% and perennial is 19 %

# we also plot differences in distribution between used and available #
# locations for our predictor of choice. To plot on the real scale we #
# combine unscaled data first:

#What do these plots tell us about how prairie falcons select habitat?

# Answer: No, some use more shrub habitat than others within their home range.

#How do you interpret selection for the most used predictor?
# Answer: Based on the exponentiated fixed effects,the strongest selection is for shrub cover at 500m (1.24), meaning a unit increase in shrub cover increases the odds of selection by 24%, while perennial cover at 500m (0.83) is avoided. Given the 7.41 SD of shrub cover at this scale, a one-SD increase could amplify selection by approximately 5.4 times, highlighting a strong preference for shrub habitat.

# locations for our predictor of choice. This time we look at #

    facet_wrap( ~ territory )

# Are all individuals using shrub in higher proportions than what 
# is available inside their range? 
# Describe and contrast selection for each individual:
# Answer: Shrub cover varies across territories. Most are "using" more shrub habitats than others. In CRW and CRW_new, they both have larger amounts of of available shrub cover but the CRW_new uses it more than the CRW. 
# 
#
# Are their ranges filled with similar amounts
# Describe differences here: Ranges vary with available habitat predictors. 
# 
# 
#
# Tally individuals using more shrub cover than what 
# is available in their range:
# Answer: 7 of the 9 use more shrub than is available in their ranges. (True valuse are larger than False values)
# 
#
# For homework also add similar figures for the other
# two vegetation types at the same scale of the top model
# and interpret differences and similarities
